# Installing

ezEdits is installed like any other plugin, but requires either WorldEdit or FastAsyncWorldEdit to already be installed (only one, not both).

* [WorldEdit](https://modrinth.com/plugin/worldedit)
* [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/)

Currently we support Minecraft 1.20+ but it may work on older versions.\
If you use 1.20.5+ make sure to update your Java to at least 21.



Do note that Paper is the targetted server software for our support and you may have compatibility issues when using a non-Paper fork.



**You can obtain the .jar file from Discord by supporting us on Patreon/Ko-Fi.**

- Once you have the Silver/Gold rank in Discord, run `/download` in a Supporter channel to receive the .jar file



Simply drop the .jar file into your plugins folder and run your server as normal. An "ezEdits" folder containing a config.yml file will be created which you can edit.&#x20;
